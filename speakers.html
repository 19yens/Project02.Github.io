								<p id="text11" class="style12">Art has always been a gateway to creativity for Toby Cordero ever since he was young.<br> 
									He would always be scribbling with markers on whatever paper he could find around. The encouragement from his parents<br> and spending endless hours expanding his abilities of imagination led him to fall in love with digital art and graphic design. 
									<br>With many years of practice and studies, 
									Toby has vast experience in digital illustration and animation with a specialization in character design. He has contributed in multiple roles as a merchandise artist, animator, and designer for online art
									zines on platforms such as Twitch and Youtube. He has also collaborated in designing multiple websites from scratch. In his works, Toby colorfully aims to bring beauty and inspiration to people in a world of commonalities.
									Toby graduated from Northern Virginia Community College in the Spring of 2022 with an Associate's Degree in Visual Arts and is currently attending George Mason University with a pursuit in Graphic Design and minors in Illustration and Animation.
									After receiving his BFA, he hopes to become a freelance artist while improving his Korean to pass his way through the language exams. During his studies, Toby works as an animator for clients. He is also working on commissions. 
									If he is not drawing or buried in school, anyone can find Toby spending his time taking care of his guinea pigs, studying Korean, and being with family.
									At the young age of 21, Toby has successfully started Porthome, a website where anyone can design anything and everything, and founded Vivasart Association, a group of leaders in arts and design who specialize in business. 
									In this 4 day Conference, Toby will be discussing about how to be successful in your artistic and business start-up, creating connections, and building community.</p>

									<p id="text01" class="style12">As designers, we tend to think about our superpowers as expertise in product thinking, interactions, information architecture, graphic design or even creativity. However, as we grow in our careers, other skills become more and more critical to our success. What are these areas that we need to master and why do they matter in building the best products possible?</p>

									<p id="text14">Vice President, InVision</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12">As designers, we aren't always in full control of the outcomes of our work. Sometimes we find ourselves on successful projects with fantastic engineers and product managers. Other times, we deal with more complex situations involving difficult teammates, impossible deadlines, and other challenges which obscure the quality of our efforts. As leaders of design orgs, how do we best control for this variability, ensuring designers move up in the company based on how they work as opposed to what objective outcomes may be assigned — rightfully or wrongfully — to them? In this talk, we'll walk through how to create an evaluation process for your org that respects all of the nuances of working in a complex, cross-functional organization.</p>

									<p id="text14">Chief Design Officer, Flo Health Inc.</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12"> In the words of Cap Watkins: “Congratulations. You got promoted – now prepare to suck at a completely different job.” This is exactly what happened to Jane multiple times in her twenty year career. She has gone from being a designer, to leading a few people, to leading a team, and now as a director, leading multiple teams. The transitions to each of these three stages of leadership were tough, and painful, and yes, she sucked every time she got promoted into a new stage of leadership. In this talk Jane shares her experiences of each transition and talks about the mistakes she made and the lessons she learned, and gives you hard won advice so that when you get promoted you won’t suck at all.</p>

									<h2 id="text01" class="style11">Lola Oyelayo Pearson</h2>
									<p id="text14">Director of Product</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12"> Design Leadership is tough. Tough because many of us in these rapidly evolving and newly expanded roles have no precedents. The ambiguity of leader vs manager puts us at perennial risk of Imposter Syndrome and sometimes outright failure. Consider then, the challenges of leading Design in hostile environments. Places where we have been brought in by a visionary, but the rest of the world is yet to catch up. Places where our skills are desperately needed and for us, our mission is clear and important. How do you navigate the hostility, build your team and make an impact? Using her personal experiences working across a range of digital teams, including a blockchain infrastructure start-up, this talk aims to provide the audience with a mindset and tools for leading Design in said environments. Lola will set out a way of diagnosing the characteristics of the environment, the tools that serve us best and the behaviours we can adopt to make the space for your team to do great Design.</p>

									<h2 id="text01" class="style11">D. Keith Robinson</h2>
									<p id="text14">Lead Product Designer, Atlassian</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12"> There is a strong perception that one has to move into management if they want to succeed as a leader and expand their influence to have more impact. For many individual contributors, this is a tough choice to make. As someone who’s been successful both as people leader and as a leader in an individual contributor (IC) role, Keith will show that in many ways they’re much closer than many would expect. In addition to his own experience, Keith’s been chatting with design leaders from all around, and noticing some common trends, problems and opportunities. IC leaders are uniquely positioned to have terrific positive impact across nearly every aspect of a business. Keith will talk through some common problems keeping them from realizing that impact. He’ll cover some lessons learned over his 20 plus year career as a designer and share a unique perspective as someone who’s currently in a leadership position as an IC, has served in a dual role more than once, and has made the switch between IC leader and people manager a few times. With each lesson, he’ll offer up a bit of actionable advice for both ICs and managers.</p>

									<h2 id="text01" class="style11">Peter Merholz</h2>
									<p id="text14">Design organization consultant, Humanism at Scale, LLC</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12"> At the heart of most agile development frameworks are small, cross-functional squads. And in those squads resides a lone designer, collaborating with a product owner and engineers. This model has lead to the quest for the Unicorn designer, the broadly skilled individual who can do interaction design, visual design, and maybe even content and research as well! This trend has potentially terrible ramifications on the practice of design in companies. In this talk, Peter will explain why the Team, not any one designer, is the Atomic Unit of Design Organisations. Drawing upon his experience from shaping teams at Adaptive Path, through his work as a VP of Design and now management consultant for design orgs, he'll walk through the process of intentionally creating a strong, diverse team, what behaviours and norms enable a team to behave at their best, and explain why the Team Lead is the most important role in your design organisation (yes, even more than Head of Design). </p>

									<p id="text14">Sr. Director of Design, Capital One</p>
									<p id="text01" class="style12">The way organizations are approaching product development and emerging technologies are constantly changing. At the same time our practice as designers is evolving with new tools, techniques, and approaches, surfacing at a pace that can be hard to keep up with. What does this mean for us as leaders of teams (big or small)? How can we lead teams in progressive orgs going through digital transformation or orgs that are slower to adapt? By focusing on developing certain skills, disciplines, and characteristics, within ourselves as leaders, we prepare ourselves for the challenges we face when leading our teams and working with our partners. We also set ourselves up to be leaders that can coach, nurture, and elevate our teams to be best equipped for the challenges they face as they execute on their work. In this presentation, Aaron will share insights, tools, and techniques (from personal success and failures) for growing his own leadership skills, overcoming leadership challenges, and successfully developing teams.</p>

									<p id="text01" class="style12">Design leadership is a tough job. You juggle hitting business goals, addressing customer needs,<br> setting vision and strategy, along with a myriad of human needs that come with the job. How do you know what to prioritize and invest your energy into when all factors are arguably important? I’m a firm believer in the designing your people and practices first so the rest can follow. But how do you do that in one of the world's fastest moving industries? Let’s talk about how to develop your ability to be an empathetic people-centered leader.</p>
